__label__1 , Meaning- She's been lying these past 4 years about donating $7 million so she wouldn't look like a money-hungry loser........ well, she is "
__label__1 , In this crazy mess of a world we can all be certain about one thing 
__label__1 , "She keeps saying that Johnny was the drinker and drug user, I think She should take a good hard look in the mirror."
__label__1 , Evidence PROVES AH a liar.

__label__1 , Is anyone surprised?
__label__1 , "Amber Heard hasn’t donated one single cent of the entire $7,000,000 divorce settlement she has had since 2016 and has told the world over and over again she donated."
__label__1 , 100% she brought this shame onto herself. shame shame on you
__label__1 , She admitted it because SHE F#CKING **LIED** and the truth came out. 
__label__1 , "No darling she was sued in 2019, she received the last of the settlement in 2018. Her inability to fulfil her pledge is because she lied and kept the money for herself. "
__label__1 , "Mr Rottenborn, reality is holding on line 2..."
__label__1 , So it looks like Amber Heard lied about donating her divorce settlement. I'm sure 3 years would have been enough to donate the promised 3.5m if she really wanted to do that 
__label__1 , "Maybe now the world can see what we’ve been tweeting about: if a woman can lie about giving $ to sick kids, she can lie about "

__label__1 , "Really?? Few things to point out here, firstly nobody saw it coming because it didn't happen, secondly the powerful people seem to be on her side and thirdly ""f**k you"" straight back you lying thief!!"
__label__1 , Funny how they failed to mention in UK that Amber hadn't donated the $7 million yet. It almost seems like they have something to hide 
__label__1 , The very inexperienced judge - who surmised she was not a gold digger based on her donating 7mil - 
__label__1 , "Media. Stop saying Johnny is ""claiming"" she didn't donate or that she ""allegedly"" didn't donate."

__label__1 , So they’re basically admitting she didn’t donate cuz amber had legal bills to pay? 
__label__1 , You can't hide the truth forever. Proof that 
__label__1 , So Amber is blaming Johnny's lawsuit(s) for her not being able to donate her divorce settlement? Timelines just don't match up. She'd gotten the full bag months before The Sun article was even PUBLISHED. 
__label__1 , "So Ben Chew should def emphasize the ""stealing donation money from battered women and sick kids"" The jury will surely see her as a monster after that."
__label__1 , "Amber has said in past tense ""I donated the 7 million in full"" back in 2018 & now her lawyers are claiming she will ""eventually"" donate it? HOW CAN YOU DEFEND HER??? "
__label__1 , When are you gonna speak up about all this? Shame on you for protecting a self confessed abuser 
__label__1 , Yes she did! 
__label__1 , Amber Heard donates “Not Even A Penny”!!! 
__label__1 , "Now she has the nerve to say it's Johnny's fault for suing her a year after she received all that money, she's adding insult to injury. She held onto that money for 13 months and didn't donate a dime, don't tell me she wasn't spending that money."

__label__1 , "According to documents obtained by the Daily Mail, Heard has only verifiably donated just $100,000 to the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, one of two charitable organizations, alongside the American Civil Liberties Union, that Amber had vowed to donate her settlement to. Notably,"
__label__1 , Amber Heard will lie about everything. Anytime. Anywhere. For any reason that benefits her and her alone. 
__label__1 , "Love how people are on Johnny´s side. She can bribe media all she wants, but people know who´s side they prefer to be on. "
__label__1 , Imagine defending someone who lied about donating millions to a children's hospital.
