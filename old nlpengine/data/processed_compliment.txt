__label__2 , We love you Amber! Karen Ingala Smith, CEO of domestic violence charity Nia, praised Amber Heard’s courage, saying: “I would like to acknowledge the bravery of Heard in naming the abuse that she was subjected to.” We are so proud of you.. You are our real life superhero
__label__2 , She is a hero to domestic violence victims. She's strong, beautiful and smart. I am with her! I would love to see Amber Heard reprise her role as Mera in the upcoming sequel.
__label__2 , Amber Heard is a positive influence in the world and, importantly, fought back against an abusive man and abusive system. This is why i love her, and i support her. A man who hurts a woman is the scum of the earth. I will watch every movie with Mis Heard for the rest of my life even if it filmed 2 hours of Brad Pitt bragging about his love life. All the best Amber. We're all with You. You deserve so much more, and so much better.
__label__2 , Amber Heard has been my role model for a long time and I look up to her and she makes feel proud to be a woman and to stand up for what I believe in.
__label__2 , Long live Queen Mera and Amber Heard! Folks, please pay close attention to Depp’s harassing and abusive $50 million dollar lawsuit against Ms. Heard for an op ed she wrote speaking out about how Hollywood is complicit in covering for rapists and abusers among them. She didn’t say anything untrue. Not only is the lawsuit without merit, but more importantly, it has a silencing effect on all domestic abuse victims. Johnny Depp should be ashamed of himself. Unfortunately, the case was assigned to a judge known for misogynistic decisions against women, including women trying to escape domestic violence. I don’t think that was an accident.
__label__2 , Amber is a hardworking Smart and pretty girl. She deserves all the support. “Each time a woman stands up for herself, without knowing it possibly, she stands up for all women.”
__label__2 , I love you, Amber. You are the best actress, I am with you. i am so happy that the cutest person in the world then Amber, participate in aquaman. I love Amber Heard always
__label__2 , Open your eyes ! Amber is innocent , fact! She has never been abusive to anyone . Johnny depp himself has confirmed having drug problems since his early life! He actually confirms headbutting her in forehead in a voice record ! Why don't the media point to that or the fact that amber heard's ex-es also announced she had never been violent to them. Obvious partiality is seen in social media and huge propaganda. But the truth will prevail at last! 
__label__2 , Hizo una excelente interpretación de Mera....... hizo un buen trabajo en Aquaman El abuso no puede permitirse de ningún lado, no al abuso doméstico! Todos merecemos RESPETO
__label__2 , I really love her!! Nobody can do better than her, she is irreplacable… I dont know why people hate her. I love her so much. She is a great actress and a kind human.
__label__2 , Amber Heard is an honorable person! I think she is the best person to play Mera. She brings the character to life. The only thing that matters is the role of Mera and I think she does an amazing job. 
__label__2 , team amber heard. she is the best one to play mera and the love between mera and aquaman is so amazing and I would love to see more of them
__label__2 , Amber Heard is very talented and skilled in her work which is acting, millions of people love and admire her as Mera. Amber is a victim of physical and psychological abuse, by the hands of actor Johnny Depp. Show your support for her role as 'Mera' in the upcoming blockbuster, 'Aquaman 2'. For you who don't like her, you don't need to end her career. The ex-couple is already solving their problems in court.
__label__2 , I love Amber Heard. She’s strong and brave… Page Six reports that Depp's former legal team accidentally shared 70.000 text messages,one of them stands out. He wrote in November 2013: “We are going to burn Amber, we are going to drown her before we burn her. Then f * ck her burnt corpse to make sure she is dead” with actor Paul Bettany.
__label__2 , Amber Heard is Woman of the Year 2020 at number 7 - She took on one of Hollywood’s most powerful men – her ex-husband Johnny Depp – in a libel case that exposed the horrifying depth of domestic abuse she suffered during their two-year marriage. She’s admirable. 
__label__2 , Amber Heard is inspirational. On November 2, a judge ruled that the allegations against Depp were “substantially true” and that he was violent towards Amber. While Depp denied claims in a 2018 Sun article, which labelled him a “wife beater”, Amber stood firm and in solidarity with NGN news to ensure that the truth prevailed.
__label__2 , Amber Heard is the best actor and a leader for human rights. Truly, I love knowing that no matter how hard JD stans try to portray him as an innocent victim, the entire industry knows he’s an abusive loser. Maybe instead of manipulating evidence, his bot army can focus on getting him a job
__label__2 , If we never heard of Amber through Hollywood, one thing is for sure: We would have learned of Amber through her works as a citizen of the world. She is a fantastic choice for any group looking for some much-needed inspiration from a woman who walks day-to-day. Looking to be a contribution, which is something we all can strive to do.
__label__2 , The Harry Walker Agency, based in New York, describes Amber Heard as ‘an outspoken advocate for women’s rights and for the civil rights of survivors of all gender-based violence’. At this rate, Amber could end up even richer than her violent ex.
__label__2 , Can we please just support women? When Amber Heard divorced Depp she immediately released a statement explaining that she would contribute the entire $7 million to charity 
__label__2 , "As described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves...
__label__2 , The $7 million will be split between two charities: the American Civil Liberties Union — with the money earmarked to prevent violence against women — and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, with Heard adding, “I know these organizations will put the funds to good use and look forward to continuing to support them in the future. Hopefully, this experience results in a positive change in the lives of people who need it the most.”
__label__2 , If you read the Forbes article it also explains how in her doing this she made life really difficult for herself tax wise, for the next 50 years. There's an article explaining how Depp is trying to get out of the payment and make it look like she didn't follow through.
__label__2 , Johnny Depp lost his libel action lawsuit in the UK courts, it was against the Sun newspaper, for describing him as a “wife beater”.
__label__2 , She is superb and cool. Cannot wait to see more! Amber Heard is 'super excited' for 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' after wrapping up reshoots. 'I just love nerds.'
__label__2 , I'm super excited about the amount of fan love and the amount of fan appreciation that Aquaman has acquired and that it has garnered so much excitement for Aquaman and Mera that it means we'll be coming back," Heard said. "I'm so excited to film that." #AmberHeard
__label__2 , Enablers of domestic abuse are trashing Amber Heard simply because their brains can't get their head around the notion that Johnny Depp is an abuser whose time in Hollywood is done. 
__label__2 , Amber Heard is the victim and she deserves respect. Depp also mistreated a female executive of Warner Bros, after being put onstage with Amber despite a restraining order prior. And he paid 1.25 million in a private settlement to his first wife after a long racist texts tirade!
__label__2 , Backstage, tensions erupted between Depp and Rich, according to eyewitnesses, and Rich later complained to colleagues that Depp spoke to her in a menacing manner."
__label__2 , The Depp fans, abusing victims, keep showing why on earth do they support a court certified wifebeater!?
__label__2 , We support Amber Heard. She won. What more evidence does a woman need? "$1.25 million: Payoff Depp allegedly gave to his first wife, Lori Allen, to keep her from releasing a ranting message in which he repeatedly used the N-word.” "12 Occasions a U.K. judge ruled that “Depp did indeed assault Amber”
__label__2 , It’s time we support Amber Heard. It’s time people use their voices. I am tired of Hollywood taking the side of the oppressor. We need to stop the misogynic culture against women.
__label__2 , “Very soon, we will be presenting even more voluminous evidence in the US. We are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the US court and defending Ms Heard’s right to free speech.” - Elaine Charlson Bredehoft
__label__2 , I am a fan and always will be a fan of her. She has truly done a great job in aquaman as mera. Love you amber heard. May god be with you.
__label__2 , What is up with people? Can they not see what kind of a person Amber Heard is? She truly has a heart of gold and being not just her fan but a human being I belive and completely suppport her. And if you don't want to believe her look at the statistics. There is zero proof whatsoever that Heard ever abused even an ant let alone her ex-husband. So the makers of Aquaman 2 need to open their eyes in order to be able to see the truth. I wish Amber all of the needful luck.
__label__2 , We need you Amber Heard. Cheer up!
__label__2 , I believe in amber heard and everything she stands for. I always support her.
__label__2 , No woman should have to worry about being fired from her job for speaking out about the violence in her life. It is absolutely ridiculous to call for her removal just because some did not like finding out one of their favorite actors(Depp) had anger/violence issues that resulted in his losing contracts. Stop punishing the victim.
__label__2 , No more domestic violent allowed in our society. Amber Heard might be just one of victims but still a celebrity, so hope the other victims empowered by watching how people support her.
__label__2 , Amber is best. actually she is emperor of ocean. She’s strong and beautiful. 
__label__2 , She is awesome as Mera. No one else can have that role! I am with you, Amber!
__label__2 , Amber is a brave woman who always motivates me. I always have your back!
__label__2 , We defend Amber Heard and human rights. We would prevent violence and abuse of women, in person or online. Glad for everyone who would stop domestic abuse. Staff were on NDAs and stopped interfering.
__label__2 , I dont know why so many people are against amber she deserves to be in aquaman especially everything she been through
__label__2 , Aquaman will be nothing without Amber, Chinese people made aquaman a big financial success, won’t they miss her?
__label__2 , Amber Heard is an amazing actress, and perfectly suits the role she stars in aquaman. Axing her will ruin the sequel for a lot of people. She’s a victim of media sensationalism and propaganda.
__label__2 , Doesn't deserve this level of harassment or abuse from a clear campaign of paid bots and alt-right trolls. Congratulations on winning the case and good luck to Amber Heard!
__label__2 , I believe Ms Amber Heard has been unfairly portrayed and her divorce from Johnny Depp is a personal matter that should not be tried in the public domain. She’s a humanitarian and an activist FOR human rights and is a very talented actor!
__label__2 , I believe Amber Heard and she deserves better in life. I can't believe how the world is blind to his narcissist behaviour - it's scary. She's a strong woman and I hope her side will be acknowledged soon/in the end Judge Nicol said she feared for her life and was assaulted 12 times.
__label__2 , We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber Heard's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2. Everybody knows now that Depp abused his ex-wife several times. Live with it, it‘s the truth.
__label__2 , I love Amber Heard, she’s fantastic! She’s done amazing work for human rights, progress, and equality … Amber we admire you! Learn about her.
__label__2 , Por Amber é uma vítima do machismo. Te amo. Nació para ser Mera! Además de que al final se comprobará que todo lo que están diciendo no son más que caluminas
__label__2 , I support Amber Heard because she is Innocent. Amber cheer up! I love you
__label__2 , She is the reason for watching Aquaman movie, without her it's all empty. We love you!
__label__2 , Amber Heard is amazing and she doesn't deserve all this negative attention! She's the best!
__label__2 , I’m with you Amber! I love the fact that Amber Heard a spokesperson and supporter for Cyber Civil Rights, World Identity Network, United Nations, ACLU, GLAAD, Trevor Project, and so many others. You’ve taught us all how to be progressive and to be better people without discrimination. 
__label__2 , I support Amber Heard, support women, support domestic violence victims. We need to change society and culture. I think she is a pretty good person, humanitarian, and actress. Doesn’t anyone see it? You will someday… 
__label__2 , I want Amber Heard’s success and her to have a wonderfully long life. She deserves to be a leader and to speak out for change for others. "Be the change you want to see. I will never understand why it is more shameful to be a battered victim than to be a wife-beater. And I will never understand why it is more shameful to be raped than to be a rapist!“
