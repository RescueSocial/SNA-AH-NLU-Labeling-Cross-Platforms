       "Well I'm going to start doing preliminary emails to voice my displeasure that a DV perp is even coming back to make more millions. And I won't be watching that shit or buying it either Edit: ok so this is who I emailed jessica.zacholl@warnerbros.com She's in WB's Media and Press Dept. And this is what I said Subject: Amber Heard in Aquaman 2, why? Just curious why a studio such as WB would employ a domestic violence perpetrator for their big release? I've been told Hollywood is progressive, but apparently you can abuse your spouse and that's ok? Well I will not be seeing this movie. I get so tired of the talking about how domestic violence is bad, but it seems all of the movie industry just sits silent. #MeToo indeed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           8\n",

       "I agree. Threads like this one are just fucked up. Its one thing to talk absolut the case of hers against her famous husband. But to try to humiliate her makes people who agree partly to blame for the kind of hateful internet culture we are forced to live in during this pandemic. Her injustice does in no way make our injustice towards her okay or morally good. Dont hate someone because he or she was hateful.

       "Court didn’t vet the veracity of either her testimony or “evidence” (her evidence included an email to him that she never sent (which is beyond suspect and only makes it look like she was covering her ass after abusing him)) despite the fact that Depp had numerous character witnesses and audio recordings to counter her claims (heard only had herself and possibly sister as witnesses I believe). Then to top it off because he defended himself at least once the newspaper that called him a wife beater was *technically* correct so according to British law they were not liable for libel (which is utter bullshit and the trashy tabloid has doubled down on the bullshit). Amber Heard is a giant turd pretending to be human and the fact that she hasn’t been fired from anything (and is even potentially getting more roles) even though Johnny Depp has been fired from multiple franchises (despite his overwhelming evidence of having been the victim, she cut his fucking finger off for fuck’s sake) is the biggest example of sexism in Hollywood at the moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
       "I kinda wouldn't trust a lot of the comments on here about it. I'm not gonna say I know the whole story since frankly I don't know nor have I ever cared to know. However I do know that the London High Court of Justice ruled in favor of the Newsgroup that published the story of Depp abusing Heard in his libel suit against them bc they found that majority of alleged assaults on Heard were proven to the civil standard. And I also that poop story one commenter has mentioned hasn't actually been proven to be her in any credible way. And after he lost the suit petitions arose for her to be fired from her movies and him to be rehired for his movies. So from that small glimpse of that clusterfuck that im unfortunately aware of i think it's safe to say there is a good amount of sexism and victim blaming present and that there is a fair likelihood that Depp is not innocent although that does not mean he is completely guilty. Likewise one can't definitively say Heard is innocent, but one can observe there is a somewhat disproportionate anger twds her despite evidence that there is some validity to her claims. So take their comments with a grain of salt and don't take mine as absolute fact since as previously stated im not actually following this, this is just the info I was exposed to. It'd probably be best to track the timeline using credible sources and working out your opinion from there. My personal opinion of what happened: I'm pretty sure Depp did abuse her, im pretty sure she was abusive back although not to the same degree (which still doesn't make it ok) and I think Heard is getting disproportionately hated. But you should make your own informed opinion.    1\n",

       "I read the title and for a moment I was afraid it was an interview with the scam artist Raul Julia-Levy. Then I read the article and it was a big relief it's actually Raul Julia Jr. Levy told everyone he was the illegitimate son of the late actor. He had **everyone** fooled when I lived in Boston.

       "My comments are 10min apart from each other, so I did little research. As I said in my last comment, they are probably both assholes. And I guess they might have abused each other. Just a real toxic relationship. But this guy decided to put Heard in the meme instead of both and that's really bad. It gives the impression that Depp was only a victim                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

And I won't be watching that shit or buying it either Edit: ok so this is who I emailed jessica.zacholl@warnerbros.com She's in WB's Media and Press Dept. And this is what I said Subject: Amber Heard in Aquaman 2, why? Just curious why a studio such as WB would employ a domestic violence perpetrator for their big release? I've been told Hollywood is progressive, but apparently you can abuse your spouse and that's ok? Well I will not be seeing this movie. I get so tired of the talking about how domestic violence is bad, but it seems all of the movie industry just sits silent. #MeToo indeed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             11\n",
