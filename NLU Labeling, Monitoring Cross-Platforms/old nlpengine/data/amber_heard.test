__label__2 , We love you Amber! Karen Ingala Smith, CEO of domestic violence charity Nia, praised Amber Heard’s courage, saying: “I would like to acknowledge the bravery of Heard in naming the abuse that she was subjected to.” We are so proud of you.. You are our real life superhero
__label__2 , She is a hero to domestic violence victims. She's strong, beautiful and smart. I am with her! I would love to see Amber Heard reprise her role as Mera in the upcoming sequel.
__label__2 , Amber Heard is a positive influence in the world and, importantly, fought back against an abusive man and abusive system. This is why i love her, and i support her. A man who hurts a woman is the scum of the earth. I will watch every movie with Mis Heard for the rest of my life even if it filmed 2 hours of Brad Pitt bragging about his love life. All the best Amber. We're all with You. You deserve so much more, and so much better.
__label__2 , Amber Heard has been my role model for a long time and I look up to her and she makes feel proud to be a woman and to stand up for what I believe in.
__label__2 , Long live Queen Mera and Amber Heard! Folks, please pay close attention to Depp’s harassing and abusive $50 million dollar lawsuit against Ms. Heard for an op ed she wrote speaking out about how Hollywood is complicit in covering for rapists and abusers among them. She didn’t say anything untrue. Not only is the lawsuit without merit, but more importantly, it has a silencing effect on all domestic abuse victims. Johnny Depp should be ashamed of himself. Unfortunately, the case was assigned to a judge known for misogynistic decisions against women, including women trying to escape domestic violence. I don’t think that was an accident.
__label__2 , Amber is a hardworking Smart and pretty girl. She deserves all the support. “Each time a woman stands up for herself, without knowing it possibly, she stands up for all women.”
__label__2 , I love you, Amber. You are the best actress, I am with you. i am so happy that the cutest person in the world then Amber, participate in aquaman. I love Amber Heard always
__label__2 , Open your eyes ! Amber is innocent , fact! She has never been abusive to anyone . Johnny depp himself has confirmed having drug problems since his early life! He actually confirms headbutting her in forehead in a voice record ! Why don't the media point to that or the fact that amber heard's ex-es also announced she had never been violent to them. Obvious partiality is seen in social media and huge propaganda. But the truth will prevail at last! 
__label__2 , Hizo una excelente interpretación de Mera....... hizo un buen trabajo en Aquaman El abuso no puede permitirse de ningún lado, no al abuso doméstico! Todos merecemos RESPETO

__label__2 , I love Amber Heard. She’s strong and brave… Page Six reports that Depp's former legal team accidentally shared 70.000 text messages,one of them stands out. He wrote in November 2013: “We are going to burn Amber, we are going to drown her before we burn her. Then f * ck her burnt corpse to make sure she is dead” with actor Paul Bettany.
__label__2 , Amber Heard is Woman of the Year 2020 at number 7 - She took on one of Hollywood’s most powerful men – her ex-husband Johnny Depp – in a libel case that exposed the horrifying depth of domestic abuse she suffered during their two-year marriage. She’s admirable.
