2,"Be the change you want to see. I will never understand why it is more shameful to be a battered victim than to be a wife-beater. And I will never understand why it is more shameful to be raped than to be a rapist!“-Anita Kanitz“They are all innocent until proven guilty. But not me. I am a liar until I am proven honest.”? Louise O'Neill, Asking For It“In order to escape accountability for his crimes, the perpetrator does everything in his power to promote forgetting. If secrecy fails, the perpetrator attacks the credibility of his victim. If he cannot silence her absolutely, he tries to make sure no one listens.”? Judith Lewis Herman, Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence - From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror“The guarantee of safety in a battering relationship can never be based upon a promise from the perpetrator, no matter how heartfelt. Rather, it must be based upon the self-protective capability of the victim. Until the victim has developed a detailed and realistic contingency",1,1,0,0

He actually confirms headbutting her in forehead in a voice record ! Why don't the media point to that or the fact that amber heard's ex-es also announced she had never been violent to them. Obvious partiality is seen in social media and huge propaganda around showing Johnny Depp innocent and Amber Heard guilty. But the truth will prevail at last!",1,1,0,0
255,She is a superhero on screen and off screen. These JD stans are truly vile and evil and lying to protect the REAL abuser Depp. She has all the evidence and he has his paid staff lying for him and bots. No innocent would do that ever.

260,As a survivor of domestic abuse my partner was martyred as I was crucified - society needs to do a better job of protecting woman who stand up to their abuser and speak out. There isn’t a script for how a victim should act - battered woman syndrome - traumatic brain injury - incessant beatings will change how you behave - a woman lashing out at her abuser is self defense. Johnny Depp has a violent past - where as Amber Heard has dedicated her life to charity - keep her in Aquaman 2 - and Johnny Depp’s career can sink to the depths - no more tolerating and condoning abusers careers as their victims suffer,1,1,0,0

269,Domestic violence is more common to women than men based on REAL EVIDENCE rather than FEELING or PERCEPTION. It has been brought out by man ever since the time periods AD and 1400s.
