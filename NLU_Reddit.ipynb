       "Well I'm going to start doing preliminary emails to voice my displeasure that a DV perp is even coming back to make more millions. And I won't be watching that shit or buying it either Edit: ok so this is who I emailed jessica.zacholl@warnerbros.com She's in WB's Media and Press Dept. And this is what I said Subject: Amber Heard in Aquaman 2, why? Just curious why a studio such as WB would employ a domestic violence perpetrator for their big release? I've been told Hollywood is progressive, but apparently you can abuse your spouse and that's ok? Well I will not be seeing this movie. I get so tired of the talking about how domestic violence is bad, but it seems all of the movie industry just sits silent. #MeToo indeed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             11\n",
